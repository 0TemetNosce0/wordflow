## Why create another application?

There are already many commercial and free apps but if you won't pay for simple task. Like learning words or checking out word translation you are passed on paid solutions. During my research there no free, neat, easy to use vocabulary application. Tha's why we decided to create one.

## Why we should learn with flash cards?

Easy to use you can create a deck of flash cards and learn it in anytime you have spare time. With corss-platform application the cards are *always* with you as your phone. You receive immediate feedback about answer corectness. You can divide flash cards into small chunks and make advance in learning every day.
