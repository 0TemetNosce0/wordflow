## Why create another application?

There are already many commercial and free card application made for that purpose but if you won't pay for simple task, like learning words or checking word meaning. You can be convicted on paid solutions. During my research there are no free, neat, easy to use vocabulary application. That was a challenge which we decided to undertake.

## Why we should learn with flash cards?

Easy to use, you can create a deck of flash cards and learn it in anytime when you have spare time. With cross-platform application the cards are *always* with you as your phone. You receive immediate feedback about answer corectness. You can divide flash cards into small chunks and make advance in learning every day.

**Need to be done**
